## How it works
 
Your site visitors can use this new functionality on your Magento 2 website by simply pressing the “Login with LinkedIn” button, which is placed where the user expects it - on your site's registration/login form.

* The extension automatically retrieves user profile data through public API, including email, gender, birth date, etc., so that you can segment your users based on their demographics and interests to run more effective campaigns.
* Give your users a more personalized experience by displaying their LinkedIn profile photos anywhere on your Magento store.
* Customers can easily share your website with their friends, which can ultimately lead to higher CTRs and sales.
